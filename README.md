# Installation

## Make your Wii homebrew-ready
To run homebrew on the Wii you have to [install the Homebrew channel](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel#Installation) or a mod chip.

## Install the game
1. Get an SD card
2. Create a folder called "apps" directly on the card
3. Copy the contents of this repository on an SD-Card into a new folder called "Spaaace" inside the "apps" folder.
4. You rename the ``spaaace.dol`` file into ``boot.dol``

In the end you should have the following folder structure on your SD card:

```
/apps/
/apps/Spaaace
/apps/Spaaace/images/
/apps/Spaaace/boot.dol
```
